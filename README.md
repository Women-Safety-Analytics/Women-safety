Women Safety Analytics is a cutting-edge, AI-powered solution that leverages real-time monitoring to detect 
and prevent potential threats to women's safety. By incorporating computer vision, deep learning, and 
gesture recognition technologies, this software continuously analyses environments to detect suspicious or 
unsafe situations, particularly for women. It employs a combination of person detection, gender 
classification, anomaly detection, and predictive analytics to identify potential threats and trigger timely 
alerts. 
 
The system will monitor public spaces, streets, and other critical areas to count the number of men and 
women present, providing insights into gender distribution patterns at specific times and locations. It is 
designed to identify risky situations such as a lone woman at night, a woman surrounded by men, or unusual 
gestures indicating distress. By offering real-time data and early alerts, Women Safety Analytics empowers 
law enforcement to respond swiftly and prevent potential incidents before they escalate. 
 
Existing systems for women's safety include CCTV surveillance, mobile safety apps, AI-powered anomaly 
detection, and public safety hotlines. CCTV and AI systems often provide reactive monitoring, requiring 
manual intervention, while mobile apps and hotlines depend on victims actively requesting help, which may 
not always be possible. These solutions lack specific focus on detecting threats to women, relying more on 
generic anomaly detection or post-incident response. 
 
Our proposal, focuses on proactive real-time threat detection using AI-powered surveillance and advanced 
analytics specifically designed for women's safety. By leveraging computer vision, deep learning, and 
gesture recognition, the system continuously monitors public spaces to detect individuals and classify 
gender. It provides insights into gender distribution and identifies potentially unsafe situations, such as a 
lone woman at night or a woman surrounded by men. The software also recognizes distress gestures (SOS) 
and triggers alerts without requiring manual input, allowing for faster law enforcement response. In addition, 
it uses data to identify safety hotspots, enabling strategic planning to prevent future incidents. This approach 
ensures proactive intervention before incidents escalate, addressing gaps in existing systems. Women safety 
analytics should include the following functionalities 1. Person detection along with Gender Classification 
2. Gender Distribution : Count the number of men and women present in the scene 3. Identifying a Lone 
Woman at Night time 4. Detection of a Woman Surrounded by Men 5. Recognizing SOS situation through 
gesture analytics 6. Identifying hotspots where incidents are more likely to occur, based on the past alerts.
